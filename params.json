Also it shall provide a client \r\nlibrary which can query (if permissions are given) the CERT/CSIRT directories and provide a common answer from all of these databases.\r\nGlobal IRT tries to provide a query and common output format for the existing CSIRT/CERT directories.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve this, a [common taxonomy of CSIRTs](https://github.com/FIRSTdotorg/global-irt/wiki/CSIRT-CERT-types) is also very helpful:\r\nwith a list of known CSIRT/CERT types (national, PSIRT, etc.) a sender can choose which CSIRT/CERT to contact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# How to contribute?\r\n\r\nPlease read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/FIRSTdotorg/global-irt/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\n# What's here?\r\n\r\nexamples/   ..... find some examples here\r\n\r\nWiki --> click on the wiki link above. \r\n\r\ncert-types/latest.json .....  the latest machine readable version of the IRT type definition\r\n\r\napi.md ......initial description of using the global-irt format for use in an API.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
